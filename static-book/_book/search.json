(We trace bowls)\nSpoon a small amount of cherry filling into the center of the cut pie crust, moisten the edge with some egg wash and fold over into a half-moon shape. Press down with your fingers or a fork to seal.\nPlace assembled pies on the baking sheets and refrigerate for 30 minutes.\nPreheat the oven to 375° F.\nWhen ready to bake, cut a few slits in the top crust of the pies, brush with the egg wash, and sprinkle sugar on top.\nBake for about 20-25 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.\nStore pies, loosely covered, at room temperature for up to 2 days. Refresh in a 300°F (150°C) oven for 10 minutes."
