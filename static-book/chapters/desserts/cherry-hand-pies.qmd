## Directions

1.  Prepare the pie crust: 

    a. Combine the dry ingredients (four, sugar, and salt) in a food processor.
    
    b. Cut the butter into the dry ingredients by briefly pulsing the butter and dry ingredients together 5 to 7 times until the butter is evenly dispersed into pea-sized (or smaller) bits.
    
    c. Transfer to a mixing bowl and quickly mix the water into the dough with a spatula. 
    
    d. Form a dough ball using your hands, and then flatten the ball into a $\frac{3}{4}$ inch thick disk. 
    
    e. Wrap and chill dough in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or up to 3 days, until ready to roll out and use. 

2. Make the filling: 

    a. In a saucepan over medium heat, combine sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and water.
    
    b. Let simmer for 2-3 minutes, until thickened.
    
    c. Remove from heat and stir in the cherries. 
    
    d. Set aside to cool.
  
3. Roll out pie crust and cut out 5 inch circles. (We trace bowls)

4. Spoon a small amount of cherry filling into the center of the cut pie crust, moisten the edge with some egg wash and fold over into a half-moon shape. Press down with your fingers or a fork to seal.

5. Place assembled pies on the baking sheets and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

6. Preheat the oven to 375&deg; F.

7. When ready to bake, cut a few slits in the top crust of the pies, brush with the egg wash, and sprinkle sugar on top.

8. Bake for about 20-25 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.

9. Store pies, loosely covered, at room temperature for up to 2 days. Refresh in a 300°F (150°C) oven for 10 minutes.
